# What are the top five skills a data leaders needs 

Data leaders, such as Chief Data Officers (CDOs), data managers, and other senior data professionals, play a critical role in shaping an organization's data strategy and driving data-driven decision-making. The top skills required for data leaders to excel in their roles encompass a blend of technical, strategic, and interpersonal capabilities. Here are the top five skills that are essential for data leaders:

## 1. **Strategic Thinking and Visioning**: 

Data leaders must be able to develop and articulate a clear vision for how data can be leveraged across the organization. This involves understanding business objectives, identifying opportunities for using data to create value, and crafting a strategic plan that aligns with the companyâ€™s goals. It's about seeing the big picture and setting a direction that guides the organization's data initiatives.

## 2. **Technical Expertise in Data Management and Analytics**: 

While they may not be involved in hands-on data analysis on a daily basis, data leaders need a solid understanding of the technical aspects of data management, analytics, and data science. This includes knowledge of data architecture, data quality management, data governance, big data technologies, and analytics tools. This expertise helps them make informed decisions about technology investments and understand the challenges and opportunities their teams face.

## 3. **Leadership and Change Management**: 

Leading a data-driven transformation requires exceptional leadership skills. Data leaders must be able to inspire and motivate their teams, drive change within the organization, and foster a culture that values data-driven decision-making. This includes the ability to communicate effectively, manage resistance to change, and build strong teams that can execute the data strategy.

## 4. **Data Governance and Ethics**: 

Ensuring the responsible use of data is a critical part of a data leader's role. This includes setting up data governance frameworks that ensure data quality, security, and privacy. Understanding the ethical implications of data use and implementing practices to ensure data is used ethically and in compliance with regulations and standards is paramount.

## 5. **Business Acumen and Stakeholder Management**: 

Data leaders must understand the business context in which they operate. This involves having a deep understanding of the industry, the competitive landscape, and the business model of their organization. They need to effectively communicate the value of data initiatives to stakeholders across the organization and build strong relationships with other leaders to ensure alignment and support for data projects.

This is not intended as an exhaustive list. I feel they represent the core competencies that are crucial for data leaders. As the role of data within organisations continues to evolve, the skill set required for data leaders will also continue to grow and change. Do you agree? Disagree? Would you add any additional skills to this list?
